        <h1> JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>Contains the structure of the page it self.  For example, building it self.
        </p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colours, positioning and more. For example, designing interior and exterior like, what material should be used and what colours should be used.  
        </p>
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>Determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when user click, hover, or type within certain elements. For example,  functionality of the building, what they are used for and what can it be done from the building
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="control-flow">
        <h1>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h1>
        <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <p>Executing different functionality based on specific conditions. And in Javascript it can be facilitated using conditional statements. Your day can be a control flow because everyone should have their daily routine and when you wake up, your day will start and this can be start of the code. And it continues until you sleep, which can be your  very last code but  your daily routine can be changed affecting by any conditions that occurs that day.</p>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>Lets us access each index of an array (one by one) and do something with that element such and adding, finding, sorting, removing, of an element, etc. Therefore loops can be your conditions that occurs in your day, for example, you can get to choose not eating breakfast early in the morning and sleeps more or not going to workout and have a rest.
        </p>
        <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>Can hold values of mixed types. For example, you can have an array that stores elements with the types number, string, boolean, and null.</p>
            <h3>array[ ]</h3>  <p>This method is to access the items in the array, it accepts a Javascript array as it referring to the index number of item in square brackets and 0 will always output the first item in array.</p>
        <h2>Objects</h2>
            
        <p>A standalone entity with properties and type, objects can contain anything in the real world such as person names, cars, game characters.</p>
            <h3>object.values( )</h3> <p> This method is to access the object values, it accepts a Javascript object as an argument and returns an array.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="function">
            <h1>Functions and why they are useful</h1>
            <p>Function is a set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value. For example, you may want to show a message whenever error occurs, showing a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, or logs out, etc
                To avoid repeating the same code all over places, you can use a function to wrap that code (locally) and reuse it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="dom">
                <h1>The DOM and DevTools</h1>
                <p>DOM Breakpoints is one of the latest additions to Chrome DevTools. It allows developers to put Breakpoints directly on DOM elements to monitor state changes. 
                    Its main purpose is to inspect and edit the Document Object Model (DOM) tree of HTML and XML-based documents.
                    DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.</p>
                    <h4>Examples</h4>
                    <h3>document.querySelectorAll( )</h3> <p>to access one or more elements from the DOM that matched one or more CSS selectors
                    </p>
                    <h3>document.createElement( ) </h3><p>to create a specified element and insert it into the DOM                  
                    </p>
                    <h3>document.getElementById( ) </h3><p>to get an element from the document by it’s unique id attribute
                    </p>
