        <h1>EQ and IQ</h1>
            <p>EQ or say Emotional Quotient refers to a person's ability to understand his/her emotion along with the other person's emotions, whereas IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient indicates a person’s intelligence level. 
            IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
            Some people say that your IQ can land you a job, but it is the lack of emotional intelligence and social intelligence in you that will get you fired. It is believed that your IQ accounts for only 20% of your success in life. The other 80% is determined by your emotional intelligence and social intelligence.
            If people has standard IQ, that is enough or even less, doesn't really matter. I think you need an experiences to build up an EQ and it develop through your life time. Also, even you have enough experiences, if you cannot build up and improve through positive and strong mindset, it won't be any benefit or advantages for your career and life style. Everybody fails, doesn't matter they have exceptional high IQ or not. It is just how they develop through what they have failed or experienced in their life. Result is important but I always say progress is the most core thing that people need to see. Even you think you had perfect progress but if you have failed, it doesn’t mean you cannot be successful. What it means is you have more chance to be improved and developed and you can do it much more better than previous progress.
            I have always failed and stood down sometimes in my life. But I never gave up and tried everything I can do, because I have lots of experiences through many careers I had, which I loved to do. And these experiences, and strong mindsets gave me courage to the next move. </p>

            <h1>Mindfulness</h1>
                <p>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seated, walking, standing, and moving meditation (it’s also possible lying down but often leads to sleep)</li>
                    <li>Short pauses we insert into everyday life</li>
                    <li>Merging meditation practice with other activities, such as yoga or sports.</li>
                </ul>    
               <h3>Remind my self</h3>
                <ul>
                        <li> I do have weakness, which means I always have something I can work on to improve and develop my self.</li>
                        <li>I need to plan my day and life but remember, nothing can be like your plan, there will always be some problems you will need to solve these not run away. And do not be frustrated when it comes because no one is perfect.</li>
                        <li>I need to be honest all the time and be patience, because nothing can be solved at once, and you will need to go through step by step. </li>
                        <li>Do not think you are left behind or do not let you down your self because everyone is same and they go through same process and practice everyday to be better than yesterday.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, remember, treat others the way you want to be treated. If you ignore or treat others with disrespect, you deserve disrespect too.</li>
                    </ul>
