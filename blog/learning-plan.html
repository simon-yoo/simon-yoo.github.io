      <h3>< Learning Plan ></h3>
      <div>
        My long term goal pathway is be a great developer and work in overseas.
        I always wanted to go and have experience in other countries as well to
        give my kids a wise experience from the other world. But I couldn't,
        because I didn't go to Uni and I didn't had any professional
        backgrounds. I think being a developer, you have chance to get a good
        income jobs from overseas as well.

        I think my top strength is Enthusiasm. I love getting challenges and
        when I go through those challenges, I feel very proud of my self and be
        satisfied with what I have succeed. But the weakness is lack of
        English skills that I have, so sometimes there could be a miss
        communication which is the most weakness part for being a developer. But
        I will be keep studying and learning to get improved and I think this is
        just another challenge for me to go through.
      </div>
      <div>
        I want to learn more of English and communicating with teams and work as
        a team to manage my tasks and solve problems.
      </div>
      <div>
        I will be keep communicating with others and asking help to teams or
        facilitators if there is anything blocking me. I will be patience and go
        through one by one so I try to be not frustrated with what I am facing right
        now.

        I have been studying my self a bit for 2 months but could't get on it
        properly because of work and families and that is the reason why I
        joined Dev Academy. It is quite hard to study my self and I don't
        actually have great habbit of how to study well in the time frame. Therefore, I really want help
        from facilitators so I can understand and graduate this programme well
        and inspires me whenever I face difficulties. I am also ready to hear
        what my defects or disadvantages are so please let me know if there is
        anything I need to improve.
      </div>
      <div>
        I will be focusing on this course as much as possible but just in case,
        because I have families and nobody know what will happen. Hopefully everything goes well and smooth.
