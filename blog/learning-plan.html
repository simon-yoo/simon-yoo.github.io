  <h3>< Learning Plan ></h3>
  <div>
    My long term goal pathway is be a great developer and work in overseas.
    I always wanted to go and have experience in other countries as well to
    give my kids a wise experience from the other world. But I couldn't,
    because I didn't go to Uni and I didn't had any professional
    backgrounds. I think being a developer, you have chance to get a good
    income jobs from overseas as well.
  </div>
  <div>
    I think my top strength is Enthusiasm. I love getting challenges and
    when I go through those challenges, I feel very proud of my self and be
    satisfied with what I have succeed. But the weakness is lack of English
    skills that I have, so sometimes there could be a miss communication
    which is the most weakness part for being a developer. But I will be
    keep studying and learning to get improved and I think this is just
    another challenge for me to go through.
    </div>
  <b>Understanding of use of code is another weakness for me. It wasn't easy for me to solve problems and understanding how and where to use codes.</b>
  <div>
    I want to learn more of English and communicating with teams and work as
    a team to manage my tasks and solve problems.
    </div>
  <b>I had a chance with my cohort mate to do a pair programming, and it was great time to learn coding from him and also learning communication while programming. I want my skills to get better so I can have better communication with partner.</b>
  <div>
    I will be keep communicating with others and asking help to teams or
    facilitators if there is anything blocking me. I will be patience and go
    through one by one so I try to be not frustrated with what I am facing
    right now.
  </div>
  <div>
    I have been studying my self a bit for 2 months but could't get on it
    properly because of work and families and that is the reason why I
    joined Dev Academy. It is quite hard to study my self and I don't
    actually have great habbit of how to study well in the time frame.
    Therefore, I really want help from facilitators so I can understand and
    graduate this programme well and inspires me whenever I face
    difficulties. I am also ready to hear what my defects or disadvantages
    are so please let me know if there is anything I need to improve.
  </div>
  <div>
    I will be focusing on this course as much as possible but just in case,
    because I have families and nobody know what will happen. Hopefully
    everything goes well and smooth.
  </div>
  <b>I think it will be harder than it though but will try my best as I can to show and prove.</b>
