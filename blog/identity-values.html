        <div>
    In Korean culture, most people lives in fast pace so whenever I get any
    tasks I always want to finish them up before I go into any other tasks.
    Sometimes it gives me advantages to focus on one thing but in the other
    hand, weakness in Patience, I cannot let it go or I can get frustrated if I
    don’t get to see the end of it in the time frame that I wanted.</div>
    <div> These days,
    my family influences me most of the times, especially my kids. They give me
    inspiration to make me self motivated and go through any hard time or
    situation well without letting me down.</div>
    <div> I am Enthusiasm, Love of learning,
    Honesty. I always welcome with the challenges which means any challenges
    that I get stuck with, makes me learn more of it. And always gets me
    improved more than yesterday. Even when I get some point of frustrating,
    because I know my weakness so I try to solve problems one by one, step by
    step. Even I cannot get it done by now there will be tomorrow, so I try to
    solve again with fresh mind on the next day.</div>
    <div> The main thing I worry about is
    english, I have lived in New Zealand for a long time but I wasn’t a good
    student so never studied english even it was my second language that I had
    to learn. So I know my weakness and I think it will take me down sometimes
    with understanding the tasks that I need to do. But I am trying to improve
    day by day so it won’t be affecting my journey.</div>
    <div> If there is resistance with
    other worker or when we get stuck together. I will recommend to take a break
    and if there is a problem, better to talk to each other and discuss to solve
    problems together not just by my self. I think mainly in teamworks or in
    cooperated works, miss communicating is the biggest weakness.</div>
