        <h1>Core Refleciton</h1>
<div class="q1">
    <h2>What are three new thing you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I have learnt that, what you say to think makes your brain work. And to think like a programmer is not how smart you have to be, it is how you solve problems and share with others(co-workers or partner) and make notes before your actual code gets on.</p>

<div class="q2">
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>I think the main value is that it makes you keep think, make your brain active. <br> But, a bit tired with too much thinking.</p>

</div>

<div class="q3">
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>For me, sprint 4 - core, Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset, was most interesting part. <br> I knew what it was but I never had a chance to study what it is and it help me a lot especially after sprint 3 because I was a bit exhausted when we started with Javascript.</p>

</div>
<div class="q4">
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I guess the most challenging aspects of the core learning is keeping in mind. <br>Even we learn and study, if we don't think again or remind ourselves, it will be pointless.</p>
    <hr>
</div>
<div class="q5">
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>It is because, when learning new thing and especially in a short term you will get exhausted and frustrated with what's coming. <br>Sometimes, you will feel like you are a loser and you are the only one who is behind but with learning core, it helps you to improve and think positive.</p>
    <hr>
</div>
<div class="q6">
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>No, not at all. It was so much helpful to me and it helped me to get going. <br> Also, we had to be keep using html and css for uploading a file so I was getting used to html and css.</p>
