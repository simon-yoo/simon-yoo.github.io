      <h1>What am I facing from learning?</h1>
      <div class="problem-1">
        <h2>Were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>
          Every single thing, such as, understanding of coding methods to use,
          understanding coding that I wrote, struggling using console.log, and
          sometimes when I got wrong with a single alphabet but was keep
          changing my coding and notices later changing whole lot of codes.</p> 
          <p>Since last sprint, I was holding my head and tried to think but, as expected, nothing I could do without help.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
        <p>I was keep searching on google, asking people around and writing down codes even it wasn't working. </p>
        <p> I tried to use console logging as much as I can but this wasn't easy too. </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
        <p>I was stressed but felt satisfied and proud when solved and understood.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
        <p>I have learnt that you can t</p>
        <p>Use google and console.log all the time and don't panic because it will always be there. So keep encouraging your self and keep reminding that this is why I am here to learn.</p>
        <hr />
      </div>
      <div class="problem-2">
        <h2>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques / processes:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <li>Trying something</li>
          <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
          <li>Reading error messages</li>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <li>Googling</li>
          <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
          <li>Asking coached for help</li>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>
            To be honest, most of the time I was just trying something. If things get not working, I tried again and again and keep searching on a google.</p> 
            <p>I think from coding, real hack is console.logging. But sometimes I don't know where and what to write in console.log so getting none outputs.</p>
             <p> Console.log showed me the out put that I got through wrong code and helped me to get a better code for better output.</p> 
             <p>Asking help from others were a lot of help to me to think again what problem I have with my code and how to run better.</p> 
             <p> Reading error messages helped me a lot to understand what I need to do or change from my coding.</p> 
             <p> Still need more practice and understanding of using all of these techniques and I can tell everything here is very useful.</p>

      <div class="problem-3">
        <h2>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. <br>Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. <br>What might you try differently next time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sometime I felt so stupid to ask and embarrassed to ask for help because I was thinking this might be nothing to them. <p>But I now know that everyone is here to learn and help each other and everyone here are on the same process therefore I can be more confident at asking for help.</p> <p> It was great experience and valuable time for me to be facing on a very big wall and feeling I have a chance to break and jump over. </p>
